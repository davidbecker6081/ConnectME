## Overview
This was my personal project for module 3. I wanted to create an application that streamlined a few functionalities that Facebook already provided, but in a rather user-unfriendly way. The goal was to create a platform to search friends in a particular location and then message one particular friend or a group of friends in one location. A user should be able to login and logout, send and store messages to and from friends, and eventually, store groups of friends in particular locations. In this project, I implemented Firebase OAuth and database, used the Facebook Graph API, and tested with Enzyme/Jest.

### Original Project Requirements 

## Self-Directed Project

The goal of this project is to create a successful web application from a project idea. You will create an app that will solve an actual problem.

## Project Scope

A good project idea should:

- Break down into logical iterations so that you can deliver a strong product on every check-in
- Be something that real people would want to use to solve a problem
- Have enough technical challenge to be worth your time (as opposed to a content challenge)
- Feature Delivery

## 1. Completion

4: Developer completed all the user stories and requirements set in check-ins in timely manner.

3: Developer completed all the user stories and requirements set during check-ins.

2: Developer completed most of the user stories and requirements set during check-ins.

1: Developer completed the user stories and requirements partially.

## 2. Organization

4: Developer used a project management tool and updated their progress in real-time.

3: Developer used a project management tool to keep their project organized.

2: Developer used a project management tool but didn’t update the progress frequently.

1: Developer failed to use a project management tool to track its progress.

### Technical Quality

## 1. Test-Driven Development

4: Project shows exceptional use of testing at different layers (above 95% coverage).

3: Project shows adequate testing (90% - 95% coverage).

2: Project shows gaps in test usage/coverage/design (85 - 90% coverage).

1: Project lacks sufficient testing (under 85% coverage).

## 2. Code Quality

4: Project demonstrates exceptionally well factored code.

3: Project demonstrates solid code quality, proper abstractions, and reduced duplication.

2: Project demonstrates some gaps in code quality..

1: Project demonstrates poor factoring.

### Product Experience

## 1. User Experience

4: Project exhibits a production-ready and polished UX.

3: Project exhibits a production-ready user experience.

2: Project exhibits some gaps in the UX.
